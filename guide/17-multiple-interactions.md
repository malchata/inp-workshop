# Multiple interactions (and rage clicks)

Moving around long-blocking work can help (but it still blocks the page) affecting future interactions as well as many other page updates, such as (certain) animations.

Ideally, we want to remove Long Tasks completely!

Strategies:

* Remove unnecessary code altogether (especially scripts)
* Optimize code to not be needlessly long-running
* Abort stale work when a new interaction arrives.
