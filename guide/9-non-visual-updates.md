# Experiment: what about non-visual updates?

Try to add a `console.log` to your event handler.

When does it show in console? Is it delayed just like Next Paint? Does it matter if it is called before or after the call to `blockFor`?

```js
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  score.incrementAndUpdateUI();
  console.log("Hello!");
  blockFor(1000);
});
```

INP measures delays in visual updates (paint) after interactions... but not everything is visual.

Console logs, network requests, local storageâ€¦ these don't have to wait for browser rendering, and INP does not measure them&mdash;unless they *also* affect next paint.

(Actually, even DOM, style, layout, etc changes are observable right away, through JavaScript, just the pixel representation is delayed)

The web has a simple, but unique system for task scheduling and rendering.
